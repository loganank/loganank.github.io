            I graduated from Boise State University in May of 2024, with a 
            bachelor's degree in computer science and an emphasis in
            machine learning. I have been working at MDU Resources as a software developer
            intern since July 2022, and was hired full time as a Software Developer I in May.
            While working there, I have gained practical knowledge that I did't find at school. 
            I have primarily worked with Spring, spring boot, SQL, CI/CD, and Java development.

            At school, I took different machine learning and data science classes and
            used Pytorch, Jupyter Notebooks, and TensorFlow when creating different models.
            My favorite class was Natural Language Processing, where I learned
            how neural networks work and how to turn text and language into understanding
            for a model, and where I created a fine-tuned model of a preexisting model
            called BERT for my final project to determine whether the text was suicidal,
            depressed, or neither to assist medical professionals.
